1) `RULES.md` contains the rules.
2) Proposals for new rules should be made as pull requests to the `master` branch.
3) Points are tracked in `POINTS.md`. Edits to the `POINTS.md` should be done after the qualifying event. So, if the result of a vote would change the points, the change to the points should not occur until after the vote happens.
